Incidence and Prevalence of different cancers
========================================================================================================================================================

## Introduction
This study is focussing on determining the incidence, prevalence and survival for specific cancers. We will focus on the following cancers:
* Breast
* Colorectal
* Lung
* Liver
* Stomach
* Head/neck
* Prostate
* Pancreas
* Oesophagus

## Running the analysis
1) Download this entire repository (you can download as a zip folder using Code -> Download ZIP, or you can use GitHub Desktop). 
2) Open the project <i>EHDENCancerIncidencePrevalence.Rproj</i> in RStudio (when inside the project, you will see its name on the top-right of your RStudio session)
3) Open and work though the <i>CodeToRun.R</i> file which should be the only file that you need to interact with. Run the lines in the file, adding your database specific information and so on (see comments within the file for instructions). The last line of this file will run the study <i>(source(here("RunStudy.R"))</i>.     
4) After running you should then have a zip folder with results to share in your output folder.
